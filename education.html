            <h1>Education & Trainings</h1>
            <p>
               We have seen the power of menstrual health as a platform for empowerment. For this reason, all DfG Kit distributions are conducted with health education. Our Ambassador of Health curriculum prepares you to speak confidently about a variety of health topics, leadership, and safety for women and girls.  The Ambassador of Women's Health training prepares you to deliver menstrual health management education to women and girls in the field; our Men Who Know program is the version for men and boys.

               Days for Girl is committed to supporting a girl throughout her entire lifecycle, from providing her with a DfG Kit, to teaching her health education, to offering training for her when she grows older, so that she can produce DfG Kits and support hygiene needs in her community.Developing the DfG Kit has been a labor of love. We've gone through 29 iterations, incorporating feedback from thousands of women and girls around the globe in the design process.<br><br>Result? Each DfG Kit has been hand-sewn by volunteers or enterprise leaders who are held to our quality standards. Why? Because what the girls see matters; to us and to them. No one wants to use ugly period products — not even those of us with easy access to them. Have you seen Tampax boxes lately?! They’re beautiful, and that’s on purpose. DfG Kits are no different! We want the girls to love and feel comfortable using them. <br><br>

                     It all starts with a <strong> DfG POD (Portable Object of Dignity)</strong>, the basic unit Days for Girls Kit. PODs contain 1 waterproof shield and 2 absorbent liners. PODs are the seed for Enterprises, because they can be sold at an affordable price point, and women can add components in the future. Because DfG Kits last years, this is a timeline that works for many women. Days for Girls prioritizes using locally-available materials whenever possible.

                     The<strong> Supreme Days for Girls Kit</strong> is the deluxe version of a Kit, and what is made by our Chapters and Teams around the world. It contains the materials shown to the right.<br>
                     You may notice that these Kits don't look like traditional pads...and there's a reason for that. The bright colors camouflage staining. The absorbent liners unfold to look like a washcloth, which allows women to wash and dry them outside in the sun without causing embarrassment. All of these design choices add up to a lasting, easy-to-care-for solution.
