               Days for Girls began as a volunteer-run organization. What began in November 2008 as a small yet passionate group of volunteers has rapidly grown into a robust network of more than 70,000 volunteers around the globe.<br>Our volunteers are organized into Chapters, Teams, or Clubs.<br>Chapters and Teams consist of volunteers who gather together, or work independently, to promote our mission in many ways. Most sew and assemble the DfG Kits, focusing on either complete DfG Kits or specific components. All groups start as a Team and can apply to become a Chapter after meeting certain milestones. Groups range in size from one to hundreds! No matter what aspect of the Days for Girls mission a group focuses on, they are all vital and important to our movement.

               Thank you for joining the global network of individuals and partners committed to help women and girls have what they need for menstrual care. Every Kit has the potential to create an amazing chain that can shift a girl's future independence, autonomy, and contribution to the world.<br>Thank you so much for making a difference in the lives of women and girls! Kits are an important way to spur conversations about health, leadership, and safety and they are only the beginning. No distribution is complete without health education, so read on for a distribution checklist and helpful hints on what to include in discussions.

              DfG Clubs are designed for students or troops; ideally junior high, high school, or college. DfG Clubs reside within schools, universities, or troops. Members will come and go, as will student leadership each year. Clubs can assemble Kits, fundraise, and raise awareness, just as DfG Teams. In addition, they have our DfG Club Handbook to use as a resource for meetings. Members use the handbook and discuss suggested topics. This broadens knowledge of global women's issues and encourages self awareness. Sounds fun, huh?<br>
              Service is a cornerstone of DfG Global Action Clubs. Community Service opportunities are left up to the Club and its members to define. Opportunities and projects could include, but are not limited to, volunteering with local Days for Girls Chapters, Relay for Life community events, or food drives or other community sponsored events.  Members are asked to complete a minimum of 10 hours of community service each semester or term.
